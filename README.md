# Unity Quick Build
Plugin for Unity that lets one create build configurations different from those of Unity's own. Ideal for creating simple prototype builds of individual features during development without needing to pollute the default build settings with test scenes).

## Platform Support

The plugin currently only supports building to the following platforms:
* Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux)
* WebGL

Mac and Linux platforms, while listed, haven't been as thoroughly scrutinized as Windows or WebGL, and feedback for and/or contribution to those platforms would be greatly appreciated.
